## crawlr.js

A simple node web crawler

###Getting started

1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure you are using node 4+ `nvm use 4`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run the script `node crawlr.js http://localhost:3100` or add `-v` for verbose mode

###Notes
I'm absolutely sure it's not perfect. I'm not confident I've covered recognition of all relative link possibilities and I haven't done much testing of error situations.
